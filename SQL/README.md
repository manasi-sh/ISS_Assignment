# SQL Module

This module contains SQL scripts for creating tables, modifying schema, inserting data, and performing basic queries.

## Technologies Used
- Database: MySQL 8.x
- Tool: MySQL Workbench or MySQL Command-Line Client

## How to Run
1. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your MySQL server.
2. Open each `.sql` file in order:
   - `sql_1.sql`: demonstrates basic queries
   - `sql_2.sql`: demonstrates callable statements, prepared statements and stored procedures
   - `sql_3.sql`: demonstrates concept of normalization
3. Execute the scripts step-by-step or all at once.

> Scripts include creation of `students` and `courses` tables, foreign key relationships, data updates, and join queries for combined output.
